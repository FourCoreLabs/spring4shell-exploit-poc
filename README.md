## Vulnerable Spring Application

The vulnerable Spring application contains a GET and POST request handler for `/helloworld/greeting`. The `exploit.sh` script starts the app container running Tomcat 9.0 with the application packaged as a WAR and uses `curl` to write a webshell to `http://localhost:8080/shell.jsp`. The shell is used to grab the flag present at `/flag` inside the container's filesystem.
